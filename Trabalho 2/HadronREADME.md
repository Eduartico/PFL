## **Description**

Hadron is a combinatorial game for two players. It is played on an initially empty square grid with sides of length 5 (or some higher odd number). The players take turns placing a single stone of their color on an empty square orthogonally adjacent to an equal number of friendly and enemy stones.


## **Objective of the game**

The last player to make a placement wins.
If you don't have a placement available on your turn, you lose.


## **Set Up**

Set the game board between both players.
Place the elephants in the center of each playerâ€™s back row.
Place the mice in front of the elephants. 
Place the lions to the sides of the mice.


## **Rules**

You can place a tile in isolation, not adjacent to anything.
Or you can place a tile to form one (horizontal or vertical) adjacency with a friendly tile and one adjacency with an enemy tile.
Or you can form two adjacencies with friendly tiles and two adjacencies with enemy tiles.
